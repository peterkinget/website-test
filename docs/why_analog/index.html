Fun Facts:

Analog links real-world senses like hearing, touching and seeing to
  the digital world
A typical electronic design can have 15-20 analog chips for every
  embedded processor
An estimated 96 billion analog ICs will be sold in 2013

&#34;CES should thank &#39;Analog&#39; -- and vice
  versa&#34; 
  [B. Schweber, PlanetAnalog, 01/2006] 

To all this digital multimedia we should add, &#39;thank you,
analog.&#39; If not for the multitude of analog and mixed-signal components
that vendors have developed in the past decades, the digital media river
would slow to a trickle. It takes countless A/D and D/A converters --
audio, video, RF -- to make it possible. It also takes basic
small-signal amplifiers, audio through RF power amplifiers, disk-drive
read/write circuitry, motor controls, line drivers and receivers,
power-supply components, touch-screen interfaces, display drivers,
thermal sensors and fan controls, and much more, to make the digital
world possible. 



 
&#34;Immune from offshoring: DIGITAL CIRCUITS ARE ON OR OFF; `ANALOG
DEALS WITH THE
GRAY&#39;&#34;
[T. Poletti, Mercury News, 12/2005]



Globalization and the rise of a tech economy worldwide often lead to
images of Silicon Valley engineers and software developers being
outsourced or offshored. But the analog engineer, long in high demand,
is enjoying even more of a heyday as the world goes digital. They&#39;re
largely immune from offshoring.




 
&#34;Secrets of the Universe - or - Look What Happened to Analog While
Everyone Was Watching Digital,&#34; [Halla,
Electronics Manufacturing Summit, 04/2005] 

 &#34;...how analog technology is enabling the electronics industry to
undergo fundamental change in the face of economic and technological
challenges, the emergence of China, and the pursuit of new killer
applications. Mr. Halla also addresses the increasing importance of
Metcalfe&#39;s Law and the significance of personal technology and how it is
displacing IT as the leading driver of semiconductor technology and
manufacturing.&#34;



 
&#34;Interesting fact: There is more analog in a digital handset than in
  an analog
  one.&#34; [R. Nass,
  Commsdesign, 11/2005] 



 &#34;Ironically, these new requirements for features in digital cell
phones are dictating the needs for new analog
functions.&#34; [D. Grant, &#34;Pinpoint the
next big thing(s) in handsets&#34;, Mobile Handset Designline, 10/2005]


 &#34;Examples include the analog image processing required
to interface a multi-megapixel camera sensor to the digital processor,
the audio and video playback DACs and amplifiers, LCD backlight
controls, motion sensors, and the power-management and
battery-monitoring/charging functions needed to maximize battery life
while powering all the new features.&#34;





 &#34;Linear targets analog
 shortage&#34; [Electronic
 News 10/2005] 



&#34;Most companies believe it takes a decade or more of experience to
create strong analog expertise, making those engineers highly valued for
a variety of tasks. And with analog becoming increasingly important as
an interface to the digital world, those engineers are increasingly in
short supply&#34;




 
&#34;It&#39;s a wiggly world out there. Analogue technology remains as
  important as
  ever.&#34; [Editorial, New
  Electronics, 09/2005] 



 It&#39;s an interesting statistic that tells us that analogue ics
hold the same market share today as they did in the early 1970s --
around 20%.
 &#34;What the figures show is that analogue design remains as
important a part of the electronics world as it ever has and should be
treated accordingly.&#34;

 Share your Analog Pride 



 &#34;It&#39;s an Analog World. How Analog Engineers bring Digital
  Designs to
  Life.&#34; [Analog
  Devices whitepaper 2005] 



&#34;The more designs go digital, the more analog performance and value
  are required in every design to enhance the user experience.&#34;

&#34;New requirements for features in digital products are dictating
the need for new and greater analog functionality.&#34;




 &#34;Design in an analog
 world&#34; [EDN 11/2004] 



&#34;Analog-design talent has become harder to find and more expensive to
develop at the same time that digital products and processes have hit
constraints due to fundamental analog effects. ... the demands on analog
design have actually grown with the advancement of digital
technologies.&#34;






 &#34;Where the jobs
 are&#34; [IEEE Spectrum
 01/2003] 



&#34;One of the most sustained demands for EEs is in analog and
mixed-signal design. Analog? Isn&#39;t that obsolete? The fact is, the more
computerized the world becomes, the greater the need for interfaces
between the analog and digital: cellphones need to convert voices to
digital pulses and vice versa, video cameras need to change images into
bytes, while monitors reverse the transaction.  &#34;

<ul><li><i>To all this digital multimedia we should add, 'thank you,
analog.' If not for the multitude of analog and mixed-signal components
that vendors have developed in the past decades, the digital media river
would slow to a trickle. It takes countless A/D and D/A converters --
audio, video, RF -- to make it possible. It also takes basic
small-signal amplifiers, audio through RF power amplifiers, disk-drive
read/write circuitry, motor controls, line drivers and receivers,
power-supply components, touch-screen interfaces, display drivers,
thermal sensors and fan controls, and much more, to make the digital
world possible. </i></li></ul>
