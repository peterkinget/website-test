* HUGO

+ =hugo server -D= will start a web server on localhost so you can view
  your site while editing; very handy. "-D" includes the drafts ... so
  if you have a discrepancy between the posted site and local site,
  check for draft labels in the headers of files

+ =hugo -d <destination_dir>= creates the site into the destination
  directory; without "-d" it goes to the public subfolder in the site
  folder; you can then use github e.g., to sync the site to the hosting
  service.
