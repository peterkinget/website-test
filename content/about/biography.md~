### Biography
Peter R. Kinget received the engineering degree (Summa cum Laude) in
electrical and mechanical engineering and the Ph.D. (Summa cum Laude
with Congratulations of the Jury) in electrical engineering from
the [Katholieke Universiteit
Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.ac.be), Belgium, in 1990 and 1996, respectively.

From 1991 to 1995, he received a graduate fellowship from the Belgian
National Fund for Scientific Research (NFWO) to work as a Research
Assistant at the [ESAT-MICAS](http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/micas) of
the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. From 1996 to 1999 he was at [Bell
Laboratories](http://www.bell-labs.com), Lucent Technologies, in Murray
Hill, NJ, as a Member of Technical Staff in the Design Principles
Department.  From 1999 to 2002 he held various technical and management
positions in IC design and development at
[Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com), CeLight and MultiLink. In 2002 he
joined the faculty of the [Department of Electrical
Engineering](http://www.ee.columbia.edu), [Columbia
University,](http://www.columbia.edu) N.Y., where he currently is the
Bernard J. Lechner Professor of Electrical Engineering.  From 2017-2020
he served as Department Chair. He is also a consulting expert on patent
litigation and a technical consultant to industry.

His research interests are in analog, RF and power integrated
circuits and the applications they enable in communications, sensing,
and power management. He is widely published in journals and
conferences, has co-authored 3 books and holds 41 US patents with
several applications under review. His research group has received
funding from the National Science Foundation, the Semiconductor Research
Corporation, Department of Energy (ARPA-E), Department of Defense
(DARPA), and an IBM Faculty Award. It has further received in-kind and
grant support from several of the major semiconductor companies.

Dr. Kinget is a Fellow of the [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org). He was an
elected member of the [IEEE Solid-State Circuits](http://sscs.ieee.org)
Society Adcom, the society's governing board (2011-2013 & 2014-2016),
and was a member of the Board of the Armstrong Memorial Research
Foundation (2008-2018).  He was a "Distinguished Lecturer" for the IEEE
Solid-State Circuits Society (2009-2010 & 2015-2017) and an Associate
Editor of the [IEEE Journal of Solid State
Circuits](https://sscs.ieee.org/publications/ieee-journal-of-solid-state-circuits-jssc) (2003-2007) and the
[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems
II](http://tcas2.polito.it/)(2008-2009). He has served as a member of
the Technical Program Committee of the [IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits
Conference (CICC)](http://www.ieee-cicc.org) (2000-2005, 2016-2018), the
[Symposium on VLSI Circuits](http://www.vlsisymposium.org) (2003-2006),
the [European Solid-State Circuits Conference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000709/all-proceedings)
(2005-2010), and the [International Solid-State Circuits
Conference](http://www.isscc.org) (2005-2012).

In 2020, he became the inaugural recipient of the [IEEE Solid-State
  Circuits Society 2020 Innovative Education
  Award](https://sscs.ieee.org/membership/awards/ieee-solid-state-circuits-society-innovative-education-award). He
  is also a co-recipient of the "Best Student Paper Award - 1st Place"
  at the 2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium,
  of the "First Prize" in the 2009 Vodafone Americas Foundation Wireless
  Innovation Challenge, of the "Best Student Demo Award" at the 2011 ACM
  Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (ACM SenSys), of the
  "2011 IEEE Communications Society Award for Advances in Communication"
  for an outstanding paper in any IEEE Communications Society
  publication in the past 15 years, of the "First Prize ($100K)" in the
  2012 Interdigital Innovation Challenge (I2C), of the "Best Student
  Paper Award - 2nd Place" at the 2015 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated
  Circuits (RFIC) Symposium, of the "Best Poster Award" at the 2015 IEEE
  Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC), and of the "Best Student
  Paper Award - 3rd Place" at the 2018 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated
  Circuits (RFIC) Symposium.
